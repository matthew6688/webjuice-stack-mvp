# Open Design Headless Orchestration

Updated: 2026-05-06

## Purpose

This document records how ProfitsLocal can call Open Design through its native daemon/API instead of manually operating the desktop app every time.

The goal is not to fork Open Design. The goal is to use Open Design as a design engine and then bring its concept output back into the ProfitsLocal production workflow.

## Current Finding

Open Design does not currently expose a simple `od generate` command for design artifacts.

The supported headless path is:

1. Start the Open Design daemon.
2. Create a project through the daemon API.
3. Start a chat run through the daemon API.
4. Stream run events.
5. Read generated project files from the daemon project workspace.

The daemon handles:

- agent detection;
- skill loading;
- design-system loading;
- prompt composition;
- project workspace creation;
- agent process spawning;
- SSE run event streaming;
- artifact file serving.

## 2026-05-07 Update

Two different concerns must stay separate:

1. **Project creation / app visibility**: this already works in `app-visible` mode. New ProfitsLocal projects do appear in the Mac Open Design app because they are created inside the shared `.od/projects/<projectId>` workspace.
2. **Headless completion / artifact capture**: this looked like the blocker, but the root cause turned out to be more specific:
   - we had a false-positive fallback bug in ProfitsLocal;
   - and several “native failures” were actually short-timeout false negatives.

Current ProfitsLocal runner behavior:

- start the run normally through the daemon API;
- watch the real Open Design project directory under `.od/projects/<projectId>`;
- ignore dot-directories such as `.od-skills`;
- require at least one real visible `.html` page before declaring success;
- if the project has gone quiet for the configured window, cancel the run and export files directly from disk with `completionMode: artifact_quiet_fallback`.

Latest verified evidence:

- project: `od-fallback-proof-3`
- run: `8691a4c6-35bd-4f0a-9e7f-a1202ca794d2`
- status: `succeeded`
- completion mode: `artifact_quiet_fallback`
- exported files:
  - `index.html`
  - `menu.html`
  - `functions.html`
  - `contact.html`
  - `brand-spec.md`
  - local `assets/*`

This means the remaining problem is no longer "can Open Design create visible projects?" The proven path now is: **create project in app-visible mode, let the headless run work until artifacts exist, then recover the real concept files from the same shared project workspace if the run hangs.**

## 2026-05-08 Deeper Finding

After tracing both ProfitsLocal's runner and Open Design daemon internals, the failure is now much more precise:

1. **Open Design daemon only emits `event: end` after the spawned child process actually closes.**
   - `apps/daemon/src/runs.ts` emits the terminal `end` SSE frame inside `finish(...)`.
   - `apps/daemon/src/server.ts` calls `design.runs.finish(...)` from the child `close` handler.
   - Therefore, if the Codex child has written real files but has not naturally exited yet, the daemon will not emit `event: end`.

2. **ProfitsLocal's fallback is not replacing native generation. It is only replacing native completion detection.**
   - The project, files, and design work are still produced inside the real Open Design project workspace.
   - The fallback only says: "there is already a real concept on disk, but no terminal event arrived."

3. **There are two different failure modes and they must not be mixed together.**

### Mode 0: false-positive fallback because `source-*.html` was miscounted

This was a **ProfitsLocal runner bug**, not an Open Design success.

Before the fix, our quiet-artifact scanner accepted any visible `.html` file. That accidentally included captured
source pages such as `source-darkshepherd.html`.

That allowed this bad sequence:

- the run captures a source page;
- assets are downloaded;
- the directory goes quiet for the configured window;
- ProfitsLocal cancels the still-live run;
- the run is recorded as `completionMode: artifact_quiet_fallback`;
- but no generated `index.html` or other concept page ever existed.

Reproduced evidence:

- client: `od-rootcause-smoke`
- run: `a38c36ca-6f50-4ef2-a877-201756bec187`
- exported files: only `source-darkshepherd.html` plus metadata
- `run-events.sse` still showed the agent saying it would write the brand spec and HTML files next

This is now fixed:

- `source-*.html` no longer counts toward fallback readiness;
- a project must contain at least one **non-source** html artifact before quiet fallback may fire.

### Mode A: artifacts exist, but there is no clean terminal end

This is the current `artifact_quiet_fallback` case.

Observed evidence:

- `clients/od-fallback-proof-3/concept/open-design/run-events.sse`
  - no `event: end`
  - no terminal `status: succeeded` payload
- `clients/od-fallback-proof-3/concept/open-design/run-status.json`
  - `completionMode: artifact_quiet_fallback`
- real files already existed:
  - `index.html`
  - `menu.html`
  - `functions.html`
  - `contact.html`
  - `brand-spec.md`

Meaning:

- native Open Design project creation worked;
- native Open Design run work happened;
- the remaining missing part was only the terminal completion event.

### Mode B: no generated HTML artifact ever appears

This is **not** a fallback-success case. It is an actual failed or hung run.

2026-05-08 isolated smoke evidence:

- default run:
  - client: `od-clean-finish-smoke-default`
  - run: `dc300fa9-6072-4c9f-9f64-2cd1b2f1c3b1`
  - result: timeout
  - project folder had downloaded assets but no visible `.html` artifact
- plugins-disabled run:
  - client: `od-clean-finish-smoke-noplugins`
  - run: `3b1575c9-f259-49b4-863a-f74418c26610`
  - result: timeout
  - disabling plugins did **not** by itself restore native clean finish or even first-html completion in this reproduction

Meaning:

- if there is no first visible HTML page, quiet fallback must not declare success;
- this case should be treated as a run failure / timeout and investigated separately.

Additional evidence after fixing the false-positive scanner:

- client: `od-rootcause-smoke-fixed`
- run: `8cefc208-e04b-4f4f-8487-00983e7b3687`
- result: timeout
- project folder contained only downloaded assets
- no generated `index.html` / `menu.html` / `contact.html` existed
- the event stream showed the agent planning to write HTML next, then only keepalives

### Mode C: short-timeout false failure

This is the main 2026-05-08 business root cause.

What happened:

- investigation runs were being launched with `--timeout-ms 120000` or `--timeout-ms 180000`;
- those values are too short for `codex + web-prototype` to reliably finish a real restaurant redesign flow;
- that made ordinary long Codex runs look like native Open Design failures.

Hard evidence:

- `od-rootcause-appvisible` timed out at `180000ms` before a visible generated html page appeared;
- `od-rootcause-appvisible-long` used the same source site with `600000ms` timeout and succeeded;
- `od-rootcause-appvisible-nofallback` used `600000ms` timeout plus `artifact-quiet-ms=3600000`, then reached:
  - generated `brand-spec.md`
  - generated `index.html/menu.html/functions.html/drinks-menu.html/contact.html`
  - final artifact payload
  - usage payload
  - terminal `event: end`

This proves the earlier short-timeout samples were not valid evidence that native clean finish was broken.

### Practical conclusion

The current best operating model is:

- **trust the shared Open Design project as the design workspace;**
- **treat `artifact_quiet_fallback` as acceptable only when real visible artifacts already exist;**
- **treat "no visible HTML" as a hard failure;**
- **for `codex + web-prototype`, do not use a timeout below `600000ms` unless you are deliberately running a failure experiment;**
- **when ProfitsLocal triggers `/api/runs` directly, also persist an assistant message with `run_id/run_status`, otherwise Open Design's Pipeline/Kanban will keep showing the project as `Not started`;**
- **do not claim native clean finish unless `run-events.sse` actually contains `event: end` or the run status endpoint reaches terminal success before fallback.**

## Runtime Requirement

Open Design currently declares Node `~24`. On this machine, the default `node` is `v25.6.1`, which failed to start the daemon because `better-sqlite3` was compiled against the Node 24 ABI.

Working command:

```bash
/Users/matthew/.local/share/mise/installs/node/24.15.0/bin/node apps/daemon/dist/cli.js --port 7466 --no-open
```

Observed failure with Node 25:

```text
better_sqlite3.node was compiled against NODE_MODULE_VERSION 137.
Node.js v25.6.1 requires NODE_MODULE_VERSION 141.
```

ProfitsLocal automation should pin Open Design runs to Node 24, or run through `mise exec node@24 -- ...`.

## Build / Start

Build daemon:

```bash
cd /Users/matthew/Developer/open-design
pnpm --filter @open-design/daemon build
```

  "status": "succeeded",
  "agentId": "codex",
  "skillId": "web-prototype",
  "fileCount": 15
}
```

The concept run generated:

- `brand-spec.md` with extracted Rich & Rare tokens, Montserrat body typography, logo/photo notes, menu intent, contact facts, and layout posture;
- `source-home.html`, `source-lunch-dinner.html`, `source-bookings.html`, `source-contact.html`, and other captured source pages;
- local `.webp` assets including the Rich & Rare logo and restaurant photography;
- `index.html` concept using official facts such as West Village, 97 Boundary Street, West End, and `(07) 3638 8888`;
- desktop/mobile screenshots rendered with Playwright.

The run event log shows Open Design/Codex completed the expected design workflow steps: read seed/layout/checklist, confirm brand spec, plan concept rhythm, fill sourced copy and imagery, replace placeholders, run checklist, critique five dimensions, and emit the artifact.

Latest validator evidence:

```bash
npm run open-design:validate-concept -- \
  --client rich-and-rare-restaurant \
  --require-source-pages \
  --require-screenshots \
  --must-contain "West Village" \
  --must-contain "(07) 3638 8888"
```

Result on 2026-05-06:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "clientSlug": "rich-and-rare-restaurant",
  "projectId": "rich-and-rare-restaurant-open-design-1778065212163",

    "imageAssets": 5,
    "screenshots": 2,
    "requiredTextChecks": 2
  },
  "warnings": [],
  "errors": []
}
```

Important cost note: even a tiny run showed a very large composed prompt because Open Design injects its discovery layer, official designer prompt, skill body, and supporting context. This is acceptable for high-value redesign concept runs, but we should avoid using this path for tiny utility edits.

## Adapter Behavior

### Codex

Open Design runs Codex as:

```text
codex exec --json --skip-git-repo-check --full-auto \
  -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true \
  -C <project-dir>
```

Prompt is passed through stdin.

Notes:

- Works in local smoke.
- Current Codex prints a deprecation warning for `--full-auto`; future Open Design may need to update to `--sandbox workspace-write`.
- `OD_CODEX_DISABLE_PLUGINS=1` can be set for cleaner non-plugin runs.

### Claude Code

Open Design runs Claude Code as:

```text
claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode bypassPermissions
```

Prompt is passed through stdin. Extra skill/design-system directories may be exposed with `--add-dir` when supported.

### OpenCode

Open Design runs OpenCode as:

```text
opencode run --format json --dangerously-skip-permissions -
```

Prompt is passed through stdin.

### Hermes

Open Design runs Hermes through ACP:

```text
hermes acp --accept-hooks
```

This is especially relevant for ProfitsLocal because our internal operating model already uses Hermes plus Discord. Open Design can be used as the design engine while Hermes remains the internal project operator.

## Recommended ProfitsLocal Automation Shape

### Phase 1: Import/Export Path

Use this first because it is highest quality and lowest risk:

1. Operator or automation creates Open Design concept.
2. Export or copy concept files.
3. Store under:

```text
clients/<client>/concept/open-design/
```

4. Run ProfitsLocal concept importer.
5. Translate concept into Webjuice/Astro.
6. Run QA and deploy.

Current production handoff command:

```bash
npm run open-design:build-production-handoff -- \
  --client rich-and-rare-restaurant \
  --content data/collect-smoke/rich-and-rare/client/content.restaurant.json \
  --design data/collect-smoke/rich-and-rare/client/design.restaurant.json \
  --evidence data/collect-smoke/rich-and-rare/evidence.json \
  --survey data/collect-smoke/rich-and-rare/client/intake/website-survey.json \
  --target-repo /Users/matthew/Developer/webjuice-generated/rich-and-rare-restaurant \
  --target-branch dev
```

Verified output:

```text
clients/rich-and-rare-restaurant/concept/open-design/production-handoff.json
clients/rich-and-rare-restaurant/concept/open-design/production-handoff.md
```

The handoff is intentionally not a blind HTML copier. It tells the production
agent to use Open Design for visual direction and layout rhythm, while business
facts still come from evidence/content/design/survey artifacts.

Rich & Rare handoff evidence on 2026-05-06:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": "ready",
  "conceptFiles": 15,
  "sourcePages": 8,
  "assets": 5,
  "branch": "dev",
  "warnings": []
}
```

### Phase 2: Headless Open Design Runner

Build a wrapper script:

```text
scripts/open-design/run-concept.js
```

Implemented command:

```bash
npm run open-design:run-concept -- \
  --client rich-and-rare-restaurant \
  --source-url https://www.richandrare.com.au/ \
  --business-type "restaurant - steak and seafood restaurant" \
  --tone "luxury/refined, match the existing brand" \
  --scope "full concept with 3-4 key pages" \
  --agent codex
```

Workspace mode:

```bash
# safe background automation; desktop/source app will not show the project
--mode isolated

# writes into /Users/matthew/Developer/open-design/.od so the source app can show the project
--mode app-visible

# use a known desktop-app data root explicitly
--data-dir /absolute/path/to/open-design-data
```

Inputs:

- `--client`
- `--source-url`
- `--agent codex|claude|opencode|hermes`
- `--skill web-prototype|saas-landing`
- `--design-system <optional>`
- `--scope homepage|multi-page`
- `--out clients/<client>/concept/open-design`

Responsibilities:

1. Ensure Open Design daemon is running with Node 24.
2. Create project.
3. Start run.
4. Stream and save run events.
5. Copy project files to the ProfitsLocal concept folder.
6. Write `concept-manifest.json`.
7. Write `.profitslocal-sync.json` into the Open Design project folder when possible.

Validation command:

```bash
npm run open-design:validate-concept -- \
  --client rich-and-rare-restaurant \
  --require-source-pages \
  --require-screenshots \
  --must-contain "West Village" \
  --must-contain "(07) 3638 8888"
```

The validator checks:

- `concept-manifest.json` exists and has `status: succeeded`;
- `run-status.json` exists and succeeded;
- exported files listed in the manifest exist on disk;
- `index.html` is a complete HTML document;
- `brand-spec.md` exists when `sourceUrl` is present;
- captured `source-*.html` pages exist when required;
- screenshots exist when required;
- critical business facts are present in the concept output or brand spec.

This does not replace delivery QA. It only proves the Open Design concept folder
is complete enough to hand to the production import step.

Continue command for Discord/thread follow-up changes:

```bash
npm run open-design:continue-concept -- \
  --client rich-and-rare-restaurant \
  --prompt "Make the private dining section feel more premium and keep the existing brand."
```

This continues the existing Open Design project from the concept manifest instead
of creating a new project.

- `docs/OPEN_DESIGN_UPGRADE_SOP.md`

### Phase 3: Discord/Hermes Integration

For a paid or internal redesign task, the Discord thread should include:

- `openDesignConceptPath`
- `openDesignProjectId`
- `openDesignRunId`
- `brandSpecPath`
- `preservationPacketPath`
- `productionRepo`
- `targetBranch: dev`

The thread remains the human/agent workspace. Open Design provides the concept artifact.

## Open Questions

1. Whether Open Design has or will add a first-class `od generate` command.
2. Whether we should use `codex`, `claude`, or `hermes` as the default agent for Open Design concept runs.
3. How to reduce prompt/token cost for automated batches without losing design quality.
4. Whether concept imports should preserve Open Design's SQLite project id or only copy output files.
5. How to capture Open Design preview screenshots automatically for concept QA.
